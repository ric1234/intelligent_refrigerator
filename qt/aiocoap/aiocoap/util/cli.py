    """Helper for creating daemon-style CLI prorgrams.

    Note that this currently doesn't create a Daemon in the sense of doing a
    daemon-fork; that could be added on demand, though.

    Subclass this and implement the :meth:`start` method as an async
    function; it will be passed all the constructor's arguments.

    When all setup is complete and the program is operational, return from the
    start method.

    Implement the :meth:`shutdown` coroutine and to do cleanup; what actually
    runs your program will, if possible, call that and await its return.

    Typical application for this is running ``MyClass.sync_main()`` in the
    program's ``if __name__ == "__main__":`` section."""
