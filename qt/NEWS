Version 0.3
-----------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* 4d07615: ICMP errors are handled
* 1b61a29: Accept 'fe80::...%eth0' style addresses
* 3c0120a: Observations provide modern ``async for`` interface
* 4e4ff7c: New demo: file server
* ef2e45e, 991098b, 684ccdd: Messages can be constructed with options, 
  modified copies can be created with the ``.copy`` method, and default codes
  are provided
* 08845f2: Request objects have ``.response_nonraising`` and
  ``.response_raising`` interfaces for easier error handling
* ab5b88a, c49b5c8: Sites can be nested by adding them to an existing site,
  catch-all resources can be created by subclassing PathCapable

Possibly breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ab5b88a: Site nesting means that server resources do not get their original
  Uri-Path any more
* bc76a7c: Location-{Path,Query} were opaque (bytes) objects instead of
  strings; disctinction between accidental and intentional opaque options is
  now clarified

Small features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* 2bb645e: set_request_uri allows URI parsing without sending Uri-Host
* e6b4839: Take block1.size_exponent as a sizing hint when sending block1 data
* 9eafd41: Allow passing in a loop into context creation
* 9ae5bdf: ObservableResource: Add update_observation_count
* c9f21a6: Stop client-side observations when unused
* dd46682: Drop dependency on obscure built-in IN module
* a18c067: Add numbers from draft-ietf-core-etch-04
* fabcfd5: .well-known/core supports filtering

Internals
~~~~~~~~~

* f968d3a: All low-level networking is now done in aiocoap.transports; it's not
  really hotpluggable yet and only UDPv6 (with implicit v4 support) is
  implemented, but an extension point for alternative transports.
* bde8c42: recvmsg is used instead of recvfrom, requiring some asyncio hacks

Package management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* 01f7232, 0a9d03c: aiocoap-client and -proxy are entry points
* 0e4389c: Establish an extra requirement for LinkHeader
